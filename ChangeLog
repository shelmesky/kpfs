	* add write function, I will use a tmp file to store data, and upload it in "release" function of fuse.
	* kuaipan API does not support 0 size file upload, so we need to write a '\0' to empty file, e.g. touch command.

	* we will use oauth to create url link, and use curl POST with curl_formadd CURLFORM_COPYNAME, this is MUST in kuaipan API

	* if prepare the whole dir when start, it could show all dirs; 
	* if do not prepare whole dir when start, and get dir in readdir, there will be a "reused nonce" error.

2012-03-21 Tao Yu <yut616@gmail.com>
